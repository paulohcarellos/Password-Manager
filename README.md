# Password-Manager
 Password manager developed in C++

	This program generates random customizable password for the user and stores them in a encrypted form. It does not use the most complex method of encryption in the world so it's not recommended for you if you are the president of your country, but it's probably much more secure than what you currently use to create and remember your passwords.
	To best and most secure way to use this program is to download the source code, change it's password and cypher keys in the "main.cpp" file, generate the executable and delete the source files, keeping only the ".exe" and the "data.dat".
